The default `capture_repr` setting is\n`('_repr_html_', '__repr__')` and was used to build this\nMkdocs-Gallery documentation.

        "The `capture_repr` configuration\n--------------------------------\n\nThe `capture_repr` configuration is `('_repr_html_', '__repr__')` by\ndefault. This directs Mkdocs-Gallery to capture 'representations' of the last\nstatement of a code block, if it is an expression. Mkdocs-Gallery does\nthis according to the order 'representations' appear in the tuple.\n\nWith the default `capture_repr` setting, `_repr_html_` is attempted to be\ncaptured first. If this method does not exist, the `__repr__` method would be\ncaptured. If the `__repr__` also does not exist (unlikely for non-user\ndefined objects), nothing would be captured. For example, if the the\nconfiguration was set to `'capture_repr': ('_repr_html_')` nothing would be\ncaptured for example 2 as `b` does not have a `_repr_html_`.\nYou can change the 'representations' in the `capture_repr` tuple to finely\ntune what is captured in your example `.py` files.\n\nTo only capture data directed to standard output you can set `capture_repr`\nto be an empty tuple: `capture_repr: ()`. With this setting, only data\ndirected to standard output is captured. For the examples above, output would\nonly be captured for example 4. Although the last statement is an expression\nfor examples 2, 3 and 4 no 'representation' of the last expression would be\noutput. You would need to add `print()` to the last expression to capture\na 'representation' of it.\n\nThe empty tuple setting imitates the behaviour of Sphinx-Gallery prior to\nv0.5.0, when this configuration was introduced.\n\n"
